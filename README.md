# GettingAndCleaningData
Repo for the data science - getting and cleaning data assignment.

This repo contains three other files:
1. run_analysis.R - This script reads data from the UCI HAR dataset and creates a tidied dataset which summarises some of the features for each subject/activity combination
2. CodeBook.md - The code book contains a description of all the variables used, and a list of the transformations that the above script performs on the original UCI HAR Dataset.
3. means_by_subject_activity.txt - This file contains the resulting data table after the script has been run. The data is organised as discussed in CodeBook.md.
